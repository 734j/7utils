Some random tools and programs. No real structure to this. I just make what i want and put it here.
Most of these are either reimplementations of certain programs or inspired by other programs. 

Theres a linux directory for things that work on linux.
Theres also a windows directory with the same programs although some of them might be slightly different because they were modified to work on windows.
